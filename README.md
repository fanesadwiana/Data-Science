HR professionals generally lag behind with respect to analytics and data visualization competency. Thus, Dr. Carla Patalano set out to create their own HR-related dataset, which is used in one of the graduate MSHRM courses called HR Metrics and Analytics, at New England College of Business. He created this data set. We will use the data set to analyze the data and make some prediction models.
